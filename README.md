# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Wishlist on Chain

A decentralized movie tracking application built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## 1. Project Title
**Movie Wishlist: Share and Track Movies to Watch**

## 2. Project Description
This Clarity smart contract allows users to add movies to their personal wishlist and retrieve them anytime. It ensures immutability and ownership of wishlists on the Stacks blockchain. Users can maintain their movie collections in a decentralized manner, with data stored permanently on-chain and protected from censorship or service shutdowns.

### Key Features
- **Decentralized Storage**: All wishlist data is stored on the Stacks blockchain
- **User Ownership**: Each user maintains full control over their movie lists
- **Immutable Records**: Once added, movies remain permanently accessible
- **Privacy-First**: No centralized entity can access or manipulate user data
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Access your wishlist from any Stacks-compatible application

## 3. Project Vision
To create a decentralized and transparent platform where users can maintain and share their movie watchlists without relying on centralized services. We envision a future where entertainment preferences are owned by users, not platforms, fostering a more open and user-centric entertainment ecosystem.
